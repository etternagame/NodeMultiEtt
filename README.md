# NodeMultiEtt

Example server for the new websocket protocol/client in Etterna (currently working in https://github.com/Nickito12/etterna/tree/uws) using json for packets/messages.

## Building and Using

TypeScript files are used to output the JavaScript server files. Run `tsc start.ts --outDir built/` to generate the JS files.

For easy control, run the server using `pm2` like so: `pm2 start built/start.js --name multi`

To connect to your local server, disconnect from EO (from network options) and then connect to `127.0.0.1`. (Normal server is `multi.etternaonline.com`)

After changing code, recompile the TypeScript and restart the server: `tsc --outDir built/ & pm2 restart multi`

## JSON Messages

This follows a modified version of flux standard actions (https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action#actions)

### Messages
A message MUST

be a plain JavaScript object.
have a type property.

An action MAY

have an error property.
have a payload property.
have an id (Unique) property.
An action MUST NOT include properties other than type, payload and error.

#### type
The type of an action identifies to the consumer the nature of the action that has occurred. type is a string constant. If two types are the same, they MUST be strictly equivalent (using ===).

#### payload
The optional payload property MAY be any type of value. It represents the payload of the action. Any information about the message that is not the type or status of the action should be part of the payload field.


#### error
The optional error property MAY be present, and if it is a true boolean the payload should describe the error. payload.msg should be a desscriptive error message, and payload.code the error code.

#### id
unique message id present in messages sent from the client.
